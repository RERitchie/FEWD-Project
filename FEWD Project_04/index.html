                        <h2>Uno</h2>
                        UNO is the best board to get started with electronics and coding. If this is your first experience tinkering with the platform, the UNO is the most robust board to experiment with. The UNO is the most used and documented board in the Arduino family</p>

                        Micro is the smallest board of the family, easy to integrate it in everyday objects to make them interactive. The Micro is based on the ATmega32U4 microcontroller featuring a built-in USB which makes the Micro recognisable as a mouse or keyboard.</p>

                        <h2>Mega</h2>
                        Arduino Mega is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 14 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.</p>

                      <h2>Code Example</h2>
                        <p>An unassigned LED on the board can be made to flash on power up or reset with the following code:</p>

                        <p><i>First initialize LED_BUILTIN pin as an output pin with the line:</i></p>

                        <p>pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);</p>

                        <p><i>In the main loop, you turn the LED on with the line:</i></p>

                        <p>digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);</p>

                        <p>delay(1000);</p>

                        <p><i>This supplies 5 volts to the LED, lighting it up. Delay 1000ms will keep the LED lit for 1 second.</i></p>

                        <p>digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);</p>

                        <p><i>This instruction sets the LED_BUILTIN pin back to 0 volts, and turns the LED off.</i></p>
